This repository contains the code and resources for the askomdch Page Object Model framework built using Java, TestNG (or JUnit), and Maven. The framework supports parallel execution and follows industry best practices.

## Technologies/Tools Used

- **Selenium WebDriver**: For browser automation.
- **Java**: Programming language used for test automation.
- **Maven**: Dependency management and build automation tool.
- **TestNG/JUnit**: Testing frameworks for writing and running tests.
- **Rest Assured**: For API testing.
- **Jackson Data bind**: JSON data-binding library for Java.
- **Allure Reports**: For generating comprehensive test reports.
- **IntelliJ**: Integrated Development Environment.
- **GitHub**: Version control system.
- **Jenkins**: Continuous Integration tool.

## Key Features
